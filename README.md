# Soliton-Experimental-Analysis
School project exhibiting current level of Python skill. 

In this school project, I needed to find the speed of a bulge of liquid in a liquid conduit experiment which behaves like a soliton. To do this I needed to back out the slope of a specific line, the leading edge, within contour plots depicting several experimental data matrices.
